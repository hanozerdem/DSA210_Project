Personalized Content Recommendation System for Netflix
This project aims to develop a personalized content recommendation system for Netflix, leveraging the user's viewing history and external metadata. With the overwhelming volume of content available on streaming platforms, finding relevant shows or movies can be challenging. The goal is to analyze the user’s preferences, integrate additional information such as IMDb ratings, and provide tailored suggestions beyond Netflix's built-in recommendations.

The data for this project will primarily come from two sources. First, the user's Netflix viewing history will be exported from their account settings, including details like the titles watched and viewing dates. Second, additional metadata will be gathered from external sources such as the IMDb or TMDb API, including information on genres, ratings, popularity, cast, and release year. These data points will help enrich the analysis and recommendations.

The methodology involves several steps. Initially, the Netflix viewing history will be cleaned and preprocessed to ensure consistency. Metadata will be fetched and integrated with the viewing history to create a comprehensive dataset. Features such as genres, IMDb ratings, and keywords will be engineered for each title to support the recommendation algorithms. The system will use a combination of content-based filtering, which recommends titles similar to what the user has already watched, and collaborative filtering, which identifies users with similar tastes and recommends content they have enjoyed. A hybrid approach may also be implemented to improve accuracy.

The project will include an evaluation phase where the system’s performance will be tested using metrics like Precision and Recall. Visualizations will be created to illustrate the user’s viewing habits and the effectiveness of the recommendations. Finally, the recommendation system will be deployed as a web application, allowing users to interactively view personalized suggestions based on their preferences.

This project is expected to provide valuable insights into the user's viewing habits while enhancing their ability to discover relevant content. In the future, the system could be extended to include dynamic updates based on real-time data or expanded to incorporate other streaming platforms for a more holistic experience.
