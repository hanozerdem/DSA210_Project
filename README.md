This project explores the relationship between weather conditions and personal viewing habits. By analyzing weather data alongside streaming activity, the goal is to uncover patterns and correlations that demonstrate how environmental factors influence daily entertainment choices. This analysis will provide valuable insights into behavioral trends influenced by external variables such as temperature, weather conditions, and seasonal changes. The primary objective is to determine how weather impacts the amount of time spent watching streaming content, including identifying the relationship between detailed weather conditions and total viewing duration, analyzing the impact of temperature intervals on watching habits, understanding viewing trends over time and correlating them with weather patterns, investigating how day-of-week weather impacts watching behaviors through heatmaps, and exploring the relationship between daily temperature and watching hours via scatter plots. The project utilizes historical weather data for Istanbul (2023-12-31 to 2024-12-31) and personal viewing history extracted from streaming platforms, containing details such as start time, duration, and date of viewing. The methodology includes data preprocessing to derive additional features such as temperature intervals, weather categories, and day-of-week labels, merging datasets based on dates, and conducting exploratory and statistical analyses. Visualizations such as bar charts, line charts, heatmaps, and scatter plots will be used to illustrate trends and relationships. Tools like Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy) and Jupyter Notebook will support data processing and analysis. This project aims to provide a clear understanding of how different weather conditions and temperatures influence viewing habits, uncover patterns or anomalies in personal entertainment behavior, and inspire further studies or practical applications of the findings, such as personalized streaming suggestions based on weather forecasts
