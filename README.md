The project, titled "How Weather Affects My Watching Habits," seeks to understand the intriguing relationship between weather conditions and personal viewing preferences. By integrating historical viewing data from Netflix (or similar platforms) with weather information such as temperature, humidity, and conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, snowy), the project aims to uncover meaningful patterns in how weather influences choices in content, such as preferred genres, viewing duration, and the balance between movies and series. The project begins with data collection, where Netflix viewing history is paired with corresponding weather data obtained through APIs or publicly available datasets. Data cleaning and preprocessing steps ensure consistency and accuracy by aligning dates, standardizing genres, and addressing missing values.

Once the datasets are integrated, exploratory data analysis (EDA) helps visualize trends and metrics, revealing insights like the genres most popular on rainy days, the impact of sunny weather on total viewing time, or whether colder temperatures encourage longer movie-watching sessions. Advanced techniques, such as clustering similar viewing days based on weather or creating a weather-driven recommendation system, add depth to the analysis. The project culminates in the development of an interactive dashboard using tools like Tableau, Streamlit, or Dash, providing dynamic visualizations that bring the data to life.

Through this project, one can gain a deeper understanding of how external factors like weather affect entertainment choices, offering actionable insights for personalized recommendations. For instance, it might highlight a trend where cozy romantic films are preferred on rainy days, while adventure or comedy thrives in sunny weather. This combination of data science techniques and real-world application creates an engaging and practical project that showcases the power of data-driven storytelling.
